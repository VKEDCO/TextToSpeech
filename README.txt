TTSDonQuixote.rar is an android application that illustrates how
the PICO TTS engine can be customized to tts strings outside of
its model. The string is phonetically spelled out, the tts is saved
as a wav file. Next time when the string is ttsed, the saved wav
file is retrieved and spoken. The example of "Don Quixote" is taken
from "Pro Android 2" by Sayed Hashimi, Satya Komatineni, and Dave 
MacLean.

BhagavatGitaTTS.rar is an application that shows how the user 
can overcome TTS limitations through human recording. This 
application uses human recorded files for the words of the first 
verse of Bhagavatgita in Sanskrit and Russian. The recorded files 
are saved in /res/raw. The Sanskrit files begin with sa_ and the 
Russian files begin with ru_. More details are in this screencast:
